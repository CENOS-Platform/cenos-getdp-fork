Q. Is there a complete user's guide anywhere?
A. Yes (finally). Check http://www.geuz.org/getdp/

Q. When I run GetDP, I get the message  "getdp: /sbin/loader: Fatal Error: 
   cannot map libUfor.so" (or a similar message)
A. The fortran libraries are not installed on your system. GetDP needs these 
   libraries for its default linear solvers. Ask your system manager to 
   install these libraries. (Check which libraries are needed by typing
   'ldd getdp-name').

Q. How can I provide a mesh to GetDP?
A. The only meshing format accepted by this version of GetDP is the 'msh'
   format created by GMSH. See the 'GetDP Manual' for more details.

Q. How can I visualize the results produced by GetDP?
A. You can specify a format in all post-processing operations. Currently 
   available formats are 'Table', 'TimeTable' and 'Gmsh'. 'Table' and
   'TimeTable' output lists of numbers easily readable by any gnuplot-like 
   software. 'Gmsh' outputs post-processing views directly loadable by Gmsh.

Q. How do I change the linear solver used by GetDP?
A. Edit the 'solver.par' file which was created the first time GetDP was run
   in the current directory.
