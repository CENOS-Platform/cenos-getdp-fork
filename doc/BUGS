Known problems in this release:

* Arguments in nested expressions don't work. A workaround is to store
  the arguments in registers (i.e. with '#1'-like commands).

* There seems to be a problem when reading some binary '.res'
  files. Some investigation is still needed.

* Global quantities have to be defined on "single" regions,
  i.e. regions of type aa = Region[num], and not aa = Region[{num1,num2}].
