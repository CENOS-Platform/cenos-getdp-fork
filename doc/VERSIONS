0.81: Generalization of transformation jacobians (spherical and
rectangular, with optional parameters); changed handling of missing
command line arguments; enhanced Print OnCut; fixed memory leak for
time domain analysis of coupled problems; -name option; Fixed
seg. fault in ILUK.

0.80: Fixed computation of time derivatives on first time step (in
post-processing); Added tolerance in transformation jacobians; Fixed
parsing of DOS files (carriage return problems); Automatic memory
reallocation in ILUD|K;

0.79: Various bug fixes (mainly for the post-processing of intergal
quantities); Automatic treatment of degenerated cases in
axisymmetrical problems;

0.78: Various bug fixes;

0.77: Changed syntax for PostOperations (Plot suppressed in favour of
Print; Plot OnRegion becomes Print OnElementsOf); Changed table
oriented post-processing formats; New binary formats; New error
diagnostics;

0.76: Reorganized high order shape functions; Optimization of the
post-processing (faster and less bloated); Lots of internal cleaning;

0.74: High order shape functions; lots of small bug fixes;

0.73: Eigen value problems (Lanczos); minor corrections;

0.7: constraint syntax; fourier transform; unary minus correction; complex
integral quantity correction; separate iteration matrix generation;

0.6: Second order time derivatives; Newton nonlinear scheme; Newmark
time stepping scheme; global quantity syntax; interactive
post-processing; tensors; integral quantities; post-processing
facilities;

0.3: First distributed version;
