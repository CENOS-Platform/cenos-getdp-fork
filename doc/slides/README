This directory contains some LaTeX material for GetDP-related
presentations. You will need LaTeX and the seminar package installed
on your system in order to compile the various files.

* To create a full presentation, make a copy of 'christophe.tex' or
  'slides-web.tex' and edit it to match your needs. Then compile it
  with the command

  latex file

* To compile only the slides relative to getdp, gmsh, the fem
  introduction or the examples, type

  latex wrapper

  and answer the questions

* To generate a postscript file 'file.ps' from the dvi file
  'file.dvi', type

  dvips file -o

* To print 2 or 4 slides per page, type

  psnup -r -2 file.ps | lpr

  or

  psnup -r -4 file.ps | lpr

* To produce pdf output, type

  pdflatex file

* To compile the web (html) presentation, type

  latex slides-web
  pdflatex slides-web
  dvips slides-web -o

  Then open The Gimp and use the Geuzaine/ps2gif script (you need to
  have ps2gif.scm installed in the ~/.gimp-1.2/scripts/ directory) to
  generate the 'gif/getdp-*.gif' files. Finally, compile makehtml.c 
  (e.g. with 'cc -o makehtml makehtml.c') and type

  cd gif
  ../makehtml *.gif
