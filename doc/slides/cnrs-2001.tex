% Summary: With its strong mathematical foundations, the finite element
% method is an invaluable tool for the modeling of complex coupled
% physical problems that cannot be solved by analytical methods. Indeed,
% automatic mesh generation and mixed finite elements have tremendously
% widened its range of application, and call for a more general software
% implementation.
% The presentation will focus on such a generalization, called GetDP,
% which is freely available on the Internet for research in collaboration.
% After an overview of the general working philosophy of the software, the
% benefits it may bring for the modeling of magnetic problems (taking
% thermal, mechanical and circuit couplings into account) will be
% highlighted thanks to a couple of examples. Topics which could be
% studied in collaboration will then be presented, such as error
% estimation or the use of the software as a black box in higher level
% optimization packages.
