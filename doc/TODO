* Arguments in nested expressions don't work. A workaround is to store
  the arguments in registers (i.e. with '#1'-like commands).

* There seems to be a problem when reading some binary '.res'
  files. Some investigation is still needed.

* Global quantities have to be defined on "single" regions,
  i.e. regions of type aa = Region[num].

Should recompute Current.x,y,z in Cal_vBFxDof??

* generalize localterm (equation part should call Cal_vBFxDof)

* add field in Data_Function for vector-valued basis functions:
generalized gradient

* define x, y and z derivatives of vector-valued basis functions

* define a 'generalized gradient' basis function based on these
partial derivatives (warning: change of ccords!)

* generalize Cal_Galerkin, Get_FunctionValue, etc. so that they accept
the tensor values retuned by the generalized gradient
