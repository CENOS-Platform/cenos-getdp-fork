GetDP is a scientific software environment for the numerical solution
of integro-differential equations, open to the coupling of physical
problems (electromagnetic, thermal, mechanical, etc) as well as of
numerical methods (finite element method, integral methods, etc). It
can deal with such problems of various dimensions (1D, 2D, 2D
axisymmetric or 3D) and time states (static, transient or
harmonic). The main feature of GetDP is the closeness between the
organization of data defining discrete problems (written by the user
in ASCII data files) and the symbolic mathematical expressions of
these problems.

Install GetDP if you need a finite element solver for multiphysic
problems.
