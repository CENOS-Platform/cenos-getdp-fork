3D model of a shunt capacitive MEM switch

Electrostatic parallel-plate actuators are widely used in many types of microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS). MEM switches can be used in series or shunt mode and their contacts can be
resistive or capacitive. A shunt capacitive MEM switch consists of a metal armature (bridge)
suspended over a bottom conductor, e.g. the centre conductor of a coplanar waveguide,
mechanically anchored and electrically connected to the ground.
A thin dielectric film is deposited on the bottom conductor.
When the bridge is up, the capacitance of the switch is very small and the RF signal freely passes
through (the RF switch is on). By applying a bias voltage the switch is actuated: an electrostatic
force occurs between the top and bottom electrodes and the bridge is pulled down,
the capacitance increases and causes an RF short to ground (the RF switch is off).
