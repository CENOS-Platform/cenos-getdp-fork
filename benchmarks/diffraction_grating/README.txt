== Additional information ==

To run the model, open '''grating2D.pro''' with Gmsh.

This model applies to so-called mono-dimensional grating, i.e. structures having one direction of invariance. Various geometries and materials can be handled. The two classical polarization cases, denoted here E// and H//, are addressed. The output consists in a full energy balance of the problem computed from the field maps. For more detailed information and associated bibliography, the curious reader is invited refer to <ref name=Demesy2007 />.
