# DDM (additive Schwarz with overlap + GMRes) for the electrostatic
# problem. Parameters are in 'params.geo'.
# Generate the mesh with:
gmsh square_overlap.geo -

# Run the code for either DDM or full solution:
getdp square_overlap.pro -sol DDM -bin -v 0 -ksp_monitor
getdp square_overlap.pro -sol Full -bin

# Compare solutions:
gmsh combine.geo
