2D model of a linear actuator

It comprises a yoke, two permanent magnets, two coils and a mover.
The yoke and the mover are made of iron.
Eddy currents in the magnets and in the laminated yoke and mover are neglected.
The permanent magnets constitute a magnetic lock that keeps the mover either in the upper or
lower position tending to diminish the residual airgap.
The mover is moved down or up by applying a voltage pulse to one of the coils.
The commutation is facilitated by two springs.
