About CVS
---------

a) The first time you want to download the latset full source by
   CVS, type:

   cvs -d :pserver:NAME@139.165.160.57:/usr/users57/cvs-master CMD

   where NAME is your username on 139.165.160.57, and where CMD is
   first 'login' (you will be prompted for a password), and then
   'checkout getdp'. When this is done, you can use 'logout' to
   exit.

b) The next times, just go into the getdp directory and type
 
   cvs update -d

   to update your local version, or 

   cvs commit

   to commit your changes to the central repository.


Developping in GetDP
--------------------

The file doc/STRUCTURE contains some information about how GetDP works
internally. Please read this file to get the basic internal working
philosophy.

Some easy rules to make the code easy to read/debug/maintain:
- enable full warnings for your compiler (e.g. gcc -Wall)
- always use Msg() to print information/errors/etc.
- begin any new function with GetDP_Begin("function_name") and end
  it with GetDP_End or GetDP_Return(value). Never use 'return'
  directly.
- if working under Microsoft Windows, please indent your files and
  suppress the tabs before committing your changes (untabify)
