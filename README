This is GetDP, a General environment for the treatment of Discrete
Problems.

To install GetDP, type

./configure
make
make install

This requires the GNU Scientific Library 1.2 or higher (freely
available from http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/). You can use the
--with-gsl-prefix configure option (or define the GSL_PREFIX
environment variable) if the library is not installed in its default
location.

By default, GetDP uses a built-in set of linear solvers derived from
Sparskit Version 2 (http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~saad/). GetDP can
also be configured to use the linear solvers from PETSc 2.3 or higher
(freely available from http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc), using either
real or complex arithmetic. To configure GetDP with PETSc support,
type

./configure --enable-petsc

For a description of all other configuration options, type

./configure --help
