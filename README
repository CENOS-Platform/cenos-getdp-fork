This is GetDP, a General environment for the treatment of Discrete
Problems.

To install GetDP, type

./configure
make
make install

This requires the GNU Scientific Library 1.2 or higher (freely
available from http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/). You can use the
--with-gsl-prefix configure option (or define the GSL_DIR environment
variable) if the library is not installed in its default
location. Please note that compiling the Windows version requires the
Cygwin tools (freely available from http://www.cygwin.com).

For a description of all other configuration options, type

./configure --help
